# CS110

This repository includes the collection of assignments, labs, and projects I completed throughout CS 110 (Programming Concepts & Applications) under Professor Steven Moore at Binghamton University.

At the time this code was written, I was a Freshman at Binghamton University.  The original code written at that time is included in the original state of this repository.  All edits to the original code were made recently to demonstrate my increased understanding of Python, and these changes are logged in GitHub.

This work cannot be submitted as one's own work regardless if any edits were made.
